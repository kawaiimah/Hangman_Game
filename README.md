# Hangman_Game
My coding journey continues! Very typical project for a beginner...

## Coding Concepts
- String manipulation
- Managing user input
- A bit of file IO in terms of obtaining words from a text file

## Notes
I'm unable to recall where I got the words from - I randomly searched the web for a list of words suitable for a grade-schooler. Do let me know if you recognise the list and I'd love to cite you accordingly.
